# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/cueLogo1.png
    - images/cueLogo.png
    - icons/홈.png
    - icons/검색.png
    - icons/인기.png
    - icons/마이.png
    - icons/메뉴.png
    - icons/큐.png
    - icons/피드.png
    - icons/알림.png
    - icons/알림_유.png
    - icons/하트.png

    - icons/대본저장.png
    - icons/영상대본저장.png
    - icons/섀도잉.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansCJK
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansCJKkr/NotoSansCJKkr-Light.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansCJKkr/NotoSansCJKkr-Medium.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansCJKkr/NotoSansCJKkr-Regular.otf
    - family: HelveticaMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/HelveticaMedium/helvmn.ttf
